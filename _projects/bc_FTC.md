In this paper, the feedback linearization, sliding mode and backstepping control methods are used to control the nonlinear quadrotor vehicle in fault-free condition and faulty condition. First, derived a mathematical model of the quadrotor. Then applied three different nonlinear control methods and showed the convergence stability and controllable variables. Moreover one of the blade goes faulty condition, I derived how the controller have to be changed. I showed controllable and stability in fault tolerant control using the controllers previously constructed by changing the input variables.
